## mkdir -p

The _mkdir -p_ command creates a directory and any parent directories that do not already exist.
The _-p_ option tells _mkdir_ to create the parent directories as needed.

For example, if you want to create a directory **/home/user/project/1**, you can use _mkdir -p /home/user/project/1_, and _mkdir_ will create the **project** directory if it doesn't already exist and then create the **1** directory inside it.

## code .

The _code_ command is used to launch the Visual Studio Code editor from the command line.
It allows you _to open files and directories directly in VS Code from the terminal_.
You can use the _code_ command followed by the file or directory path to open it in VS Code.

For example, **code myfile.txt** will open the **myfile.txt** file in VS Code.

## mv

The _mv_ command is used to _move or rename_ files or directories.
It can be used to _rename_ a file or directory, _move_ a file or directory to a different location, or _both at the same time._

The basic syntax of the mv command is: mv **< what >** **< to where >**
_mv file1.txt project1/_

to **rename** a file called file1.txt to file2.txt,
you would use _mv file1.txt file2.txt_
